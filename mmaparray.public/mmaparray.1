NAME
	mmaparray -- tool used to create, inspect, and modify arrays that exist on the disk as files

SYNOPSIS
	mmaparray [--filename char *s1] [--index int] [--name char *s2] [--age int] [--set] [--get] [--create] [--print] [--maxindex] [--delete]

DESCRIPTION
	The program mmaparray uses the mmap system call to access and modify arrays that exist on the disk as files. 

	The program mmaparray memory maps files and manipulates them as an array. Manipulation and access of the contents in the arrays is done through the following command line           arguments:

		--filename	the filename of the file to be accessed
		--index		the index to be used
		--name		the name to be used for a command on an entry  
		--age		the age to be used for a command on an entry
		--set		modifies the array based on specified args 
		--get		prints array element(s) based on specified args
		--create	creates a file with name and index from filename and index args
		--print		prints all entries in the array
		--maxindex	returns the maximum index of the specified array
		--delete	removes the element pointed to by the index arg

EXIT STATUS
	In successful execution, the program behaves as expected and exits with status 0.

	In the occurrence of an error, program mmaparray writes the error to stderr and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLE
	The command:

		./mmaparray --filename file1 --index 3 --name Alice --age 19 --set --print 

	will insert an entry with name Alice and age 19 at index 3 of file file1, and then 	      print all the entries currently in the array.

	The command:

		./mmaparray --filename file2 --index 7 --get

	will return the entry at index 7 in the file file2.

	The command:

		./mmaparray --filename file3 --create --index 10

	will create a file with name file3 and size 10.
